# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning Regression

## Description
This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning regression techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. The project utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.

## Features
- Data collection from various sources, including real estate websites or CSV files.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Implementation of multiple regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Visualization of house price trends and model predictions.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn` (optional, for enhanced visualizations)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
