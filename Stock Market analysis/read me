# Stock Market Analysis using Machine Learning Regression

## Description
This project focuses on analyzing stock market data using machine learning regression techniques. The goal is to predict stock prices based on historical data and various market indicators. The project utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.

## Features
- Data collection from various stock market APIs or CSV files.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Implementation of multiple regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
- Model evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- Visualization of stock price trends and model predictions.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn` (optional, for enhanced visualizations)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
